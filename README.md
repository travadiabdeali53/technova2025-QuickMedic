Project Name
QuickMedic: AI-Powered Unified Healthcare Platform

Problem Statement
Accessing healthcare services is currently fragmented and slow. Patients often have to visit separate platforms to book doctors, order medicines, and view lab reports. Furthermore, in critical medical emergencies (like heart attacks or falls), elderly and disabled patients often cannot physically interact with a phone screen to call for help, leading to fatal delays.

How It Works
QuickMedic acts as a "Digital Hospital" that unifies all medical services into one accessible dashboard.

Unified Ecosystem: Users can book appointments, order medicines, and download lab reports from a single interface.


AI Symptom Triage: A built-in chatbot analyzes user symptoms (e.g., "fever") and provides immediate first-aid advice and doctor recommendations.

Smart Navigation: Users can navigate the entire site using voice commands (e.g., "Open Pharmacy"), making it fully accessible for the visually impaired.

Tech Stack Used
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Glassmorphism & Dark Mode)


Scripting: JavaScript (ES6+)

AI & APIs:

Web Speech API: For Voice Recognition and Text-to-Speech.

Custom JS Logic: For rule-based Chatbot response handling.

Hosting: GitHub Pages (Static Deployment)
